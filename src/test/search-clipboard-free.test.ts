 * the clipboard. When a file holds exactly one match there is nothing to
 * disambiguate, so that alone is enough to reveal the right place - and the
 * clipboard, which `vscode.env.clipboard` can only round-trip as text, is left
 * alone.
 *
 * Searches the repo's own fixture notes rather than a temp file, so the counts
 * reflect real notes.
