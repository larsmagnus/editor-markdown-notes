/**
 * Scrolls a note opened from a search result to its match, and highlights every
 * other place the same text occurs.
 *
 * The host names one match; the rest are found here by looking for its text, so
 * the first occurrence in document order is the one scrolled to.
 *
 * Fires once per editor instance, which the dependency alone gives - and it has
 * to be per instance, not per panel. TipTap rebuilds the editor during startup,
 * so a `useRef` guard meant to fire "only once" let the first, discarded editor
 * consume the reveal and left the one on screen with neither highlight nor
 * scroll.
 *
 * Silent when the searched-for text is not in the rendered document. That
 * happens when the match spanned markdown syntax the editor no longer shows -
 * the `**` of a bold run, a link's target - and the honest answer there is to
 * leave the note where it opened rather than scroll somewhere approximate.
