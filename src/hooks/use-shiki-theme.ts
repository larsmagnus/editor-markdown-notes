 * dark theme's text colors over a light background, which reads as unreadable
 * noise. So the host's extracted theme is only used when its own `kind`
 * matches the current side of that toggle; the *other* side always keeps the
 * bundled default for its kind, which is guaranteed to be readable no matter
 * which VS Code theme is active. A theme the host failed to extract behaves
 * the same as one that doesn't match - the bundled default for the current
 * side is used.
 *
 * Outside VS Code (the standalone web build), no host theme ever arrives, so
 * the bundled default is permanent there too.
