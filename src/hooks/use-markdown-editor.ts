/**
 * Everything the editor needs to run one note: the TipTap instance, autosync,
 * the writing checks and the live italic marker.
 *
 * Composed here rather than in the component so the component is only layout,
 * and so the order these depend on each other is stated once.
 *
 * `syncContent` comes from the caller rather than from `useHostDocument` here,
 * because that hook holds state: calling it twice would give the editor a
 * second, private copy of the document, and every sync would land in the one
 * nothing else reads. It is optional since only the VS Code path ever writes -
 * standalone, `useNoteSync` routes to the `updateNotes` stub instead.
 *
 * `active` is false while raw mode is on screen instead (`EditorBody`), which
 * now keeps this editor mounted rather than tearing it down - it still has to
 * absorb incoming content while hidden, so only the expensive or
 * visibility-only parts (autosync, the writing checks, syntax highlighting,
 * "Skip to editor") gate on it.
 *
 * `analyzer` comes from `EditorBody` when it renders inside the full app - one
 * `useAnalyzer()` shared with the raw editor's own writing checks, since each
 * spinning up its own would mean two workers and two copies of the ~575kB
 * spelling dictionary for the same note. Falls back to an analyzer owned here
 * for every standalone mount (stories, component tests) that has no
 * `EditorBody` to share one with.
 *
 * `fileKind` picks the schema once, at construction - a panel is bound to one
 * file for its lifetime, so nothing here reacts to it changing later.
