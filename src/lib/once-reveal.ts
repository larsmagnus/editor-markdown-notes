 * acted on, and it has to be acted on exactly once - VS Code destroys the
 * webview for a backgrounded tab and rebuilds it from the HTML it already
 * holds, so the same reveal arrives again, looking brand new, every time the
 * reader switches back to the tab. Only the panel's own state survives that,
 * so that is where "already done" is recorded, keyed by `consumedKey`.
 *
 * Ask `has` while rendering, not from an effect: whoever calls `take` does so
 * in an effect, and a child's effects run before its parent's, so a parent
 * asking later would be told the reveal had already gone.
