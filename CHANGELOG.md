# Change Log

All notable changes to the "editor-markdown-notes" extension are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Added scrolling to the matched text when a note is opened from a search result, with every occurrence of that text highlighted
- Added an info button to each writing tools check, explaining what it looks for and showing an example of the fix marked the way the editor marks it
- Added a spelling check to the writing tools, underlining unrecognised words in red and listing them with suggested corrections. Switch it on in the panel; it is off by default
- Added a choice of American, British or Australian English for the spelling check, beside the check itself or from the "Select spelling language" command
- Changed the writing tools to skip inline code spans and the keys in YAML frontmatter, which were never prose worth checking
- Added a zero-config MCP server, so AI agents in the editor can run the same writing checks as the text tools against your target reading age, language and custom words list.
- Added an "Add words to dictionary" command for teaching the spelling check project vocabulary it should stop flagging

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-17

- Added remembering where each note is scrolled to, restoring it when the note is reopened in the same VS Code session
- Fixed a note opening scrolled into the middle of itself instead of at the top
- Changed a note to open with no cursor placed in it, so click into the note before typing
- Added an "Ask Claude" slash command: type `/ask` followed by a prompt to have Claude rewrite that part of the note in place, with a spinner while it works and an error card with retry and dismiss if it fails
- Added a sparkles button to the bubble menu that asks Claude to simplify, shorten, improve, or otherwise rewrite the selected text, showing the proposed rewrite alongside the original as editable text with accept, decline, retry, and an option to keep both
- Changed the "Ask Claude" slash command and bubble menu button to hide in the standalone web app, where there is no extension host to ask
- Added a slash command menu: type `/` on an empty line to insert a mermaid diagram, code block, task list, table, or image
- Added `editorMarkdownNotes.imageCopyDirectory` for where the slash command's image action copies a file picked from outside the workspace
- Added a copy button to the toolbar for copying the note as markdown or plain text, and for opening it in Claude
- Added `editorMarkdownNotes.claudePromptTemplate` to customize the prompt sent when opening a note in Claude
- Added zoom and pan controls to mermaid diagrams in the live editor: Ctrl/Cmd+scroll or the toolbar to zoom, drag to pan
- Added a diagram toolbar for copying a diagram's source or its rendered SVG, opening it in Claude, and editing its source
- Added `editorMarkdownNotes.claudeInlinePromptTemplate` for the prompt sent when opening a single diagram in Claude
- Changed the Claude prompt templates to take `%@` for the note as an at-reference, alongside the existing `%s`
- Fixed the toolbar's copy actions handing back the note as it was when the tab was opened, rather than as edited
- Fixed "Open in Claude" replacing the clipboard without saying so, outside VS Code

- Added a copy button, a delete button, and syntax highlighting to the frontmatter block in the live editor
- Added a button to add a frontmatter block to a note that doesn't already have one
